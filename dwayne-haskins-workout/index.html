   Dwayne Haskins has to jump two veterans in Redskins’ QB competition from fitness-diets.com  For quite some time now, the feeling has been that the new york giants will take ohio state quarterback dwayne haskins with the sixth overall pick in the nfl draft later this month. Before dwayne haskins tragically passed away on saturday, he was just enjoying his time with the pittsburgh steelers and was even joking with teammate najee harris. An espn report also showed that haskins lowered his body fat last season from 17 percent to 13 percent, another reason to believe he should have increased mobility this fall.
